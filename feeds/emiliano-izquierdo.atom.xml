Old bridge, Heidelberg October 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wide"&gt;&lt;span class="drop-cap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here is nothing special, or there might not be anything special about Heidelberg. It might very well be, that the city, and its ihabitants and whatever surrounds the city, makes up for just another good example of a german university town. However, for me Heidelberg happens to be a very special place. I like to believe that the city is composed of a well balanced mixture of many small but enjoyable details. Each of those tiny pieces arranged together in such a configuration that makes the city livable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is small. Take your bike and ride to every corner with ease. Up and down the Königstuhl, pass the Weststadt, through Plöck and into the city center. Take a view of the city from across the old bridge, go and catch fresh air, climb to the Philosophenweg and hike into the woods. Visit the Thingstätte.&lt;/p&gt;

Castle, Heidelberg October 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ha-jo!&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 8 years since I arrived to Heidelberg. Here I studied a Master and a PhD. Here I met a lot of my current friends. Through my international firends I got to learn about the cultures of various conuntries. Through &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sidenote sans dim framed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ha-jo!&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;Narrenruff&lt;/em&gt; in Heidelberg. This celebration calling is shouted out loud during the street parade and the &lt;em&gt;Fastnacht&lt;/em&gt; (carnival) festivities to demonstrate an expression of a joyfull spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a place where not a single day passes without a commute over the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s history and a university with its traditions
There are various things which I very much appreciate a &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent here the past eight years and very meaningful moments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do get to miss Heidelberg in every opportunity I happend to travel to other places in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few places are like Heidelberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 8 years since I arrived to Heidelberg. Here I studied a Master and a PhD. Here I met a lot of my current friends. Here I learned and embraced both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I go and visit other places I end up missing Heidelberg and I&amp;rsquo;m always really happy when I return. It has become a good reference to me to assess how much I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidelberg is not only the city but also it&amp;rsquo;s sorroundings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it feels like home. Soon I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult not to think how much I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss this city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can I say about Hiedelberg? For me it has been an amazing time living in this city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="drop-cap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince a couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of retiring from social-media platforms like Facebook, Twitter&amp;hellip; you name it. The truth is that letting them go has been quite a hassle. They have become very practical tools to keep in contact with family, friends and freetime interests, all in one place. They have also become an important source of news and information. I&amp;rsquo;ve profited and experienced them in very positive ways, however, as an avalanche of marketing and privacy concerns continues to grow, their intrusiveness has already outweighed their benefit. Added to this, the amount of misinformation imposes a high price on the time required to cherry-pick the relevant stuff. Moreover, the prevasiveness of fake news might as well be affecting us in ways we do not concioussly recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going cold turkey might not be the best current solution to the social-media paradox. However, perhaps by adopting a gradual and more constructive strategy will, if not effectivley, at least more creatively balance out their requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is aimed at keeping an internet presence while adding a little more custom and non-intrusive look at stuff that I like and do. I hope that by doing so, in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to disregard social-media while gaining some skills at writing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="internet"></category><category term="social media"></category></entry></feed>
