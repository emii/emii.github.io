&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="drop-cap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince a couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of retiring from social-media platforms like Facebook, Twitter&amp;hellip; you name it. The truth is that letting them go has been quite a hasle. They have become a very practical tool to keep relatedness to family, friends and freetime interests, all in one place. They have also become an important source of news and information. I&amp;rsquo;ve profited and experinced them in very positive ways, however, as an avalanche of marketing and privacy concerns continues to grow, their intrusiveness has already outweighed their benefit. Added to this, the amount of misinformation imposes a high price on the time required to cherry-pick the relevant stuff. Moreover, the prevasiveness of fake news might as well be affecting us in ways we do not concioussly recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going cold turkey might not be the best current solution to the social-media paradox. However, perhaps by adopting a gradual and more constructive strategy will, if not effectivley, at least more creatively balance out their requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is aimed at keeping an internet presence while adding a little more custom and non-intrusive look at stuff that I like and do. I hope that by doing so, in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to disregard social-media while gaining some skills at writting. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Emiliano Izquierdo</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 21:31:32 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:sndbx.be,2019-06-07:new-beginnings/hello-internet/</guid><category>writting</category><category>internet</category><category>opinion</category><category>social media</category></item></channel></rss>
