At home in Guanajuato, Mexico March 2019</p>
<p class="wide"><span class="drop-cap">E</span>arlier last year (2018) I got to learn pottery and ceramics. What started to be a simple experiment where I would make a pinch pot &ndash;one time a bowl, one other time a cup&ndash; pottery rapidly developed into a serious hobby; perhaps a temporal obsession. Early during the discovery process, I got to watch all the <a href="https://www.goldmarkart.com/ceramics">Goldmark Gallery</a> videos featuring well known potters as they are Lisa Hammond, Phil Rogers, Anne Mette Hjortshøj, Ken Matsuzaki among many others. Soon I was hooked, every video was charged with beauty. Every time I would watch a video, I would get more and more trapped into the handcrafting process, and also into imagining my way into more advanced pottery techniques. First, it was throwing on the wheel, later it was developing my own glazes, another time it would be learning a different firing method.</p>
<p class="wide">This time it was about pottery wheels. It was precisely on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLYivjLbWxg">Ken Matsuzaki&rsquo;s video</a> where I got to see him throwing chawan teabowls on a wooden pottery kick-wheel or <em>kerokuro</em> (<code>蹴ろくろ</code>) as it is called in Japanese or <em>balmulle</em> (<code>발물레</code>) in Korean. The take was an enjoyable feature of craftsmanship, and at its center there was the traditional Japanese wooden kerokuro.</p>

<p class="wide mono dim">Detailed views of the kerokuro</p>
<p class="float-left">The kerokuro is in essence very simple; it is made of two parts. The flying wheel which is a single piece completely made of wood, and the fixed base which is a metal plate soldered to a shaft. The flying wheel is composed of a bottom kick wheel and top turntable. These are joined through four wooden poles that transmit the work of the kick from the bottom to the top. The flying wheel is suspended onto the shaft and relies on a pin and a cup system to rotate, whereby a pin is fixed at the bottom of the turntable, and a receiving cup which is drilled on the top end of the shaft. While this is enough to provide the full functionality of the wheel, the overall stability is further enhanced by a flange bearing attached to the bottom wheel. This ball bearing constrains the lateral movement of the wheel and helps maintaining the rotation around the vertical axis.</p>
<p class="dim sidenote framed sans">Technical note: there are other assembly setups where instead of a pin and cup system, a flange bearing is used on the top turntable. While such a setup simplifies the construction of the flying wheel, it requires extra work on the shaft, as it has to be partially lathe-cut to provide an offset onto which the flange bearing will sit. Moreover, in such a scenario, the load distribution is not appropriate for a flange bearing: which is designed for supporting radial loads. A better fit would be to use an angular contact ball-bearing or a tappered roller-bearing which would play well with both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)#Loads">axial and radial loads</a> generated during the turning of the wheel. In addition, they would balance the loads to better maintain the angular momentum.</p>

<p class="mono dim" style="line-height:1em">Sketch of the design. Left: rough measurements for the wheel head and the shaft. Right: pin and cup measurements</p>

<p class="sans wide"><strong>Last year, I got to build a kerokuro from scratch. From plain wood beams until its functioning state were a the end of the day I would throw some pots on it.</strong></p>
<p class="wide">The journey of building a kerokuro began with the design. Despite the simplicity of the mechanism, the precise construction of the artifact required a couple of considerations. The availability and selection of wood, the tools at hand, the access to expert knowledge. These were factors that could either make it easier or harder to carry out the project to its best possible outcome. After a thorough internet research where only a couple of blog posts with little details where available (I also translate-searched Japanese websites), I managed to get a rough idea of which important design decisions had to be made, the rest, I kind of eye-balled it from pictures found on the internet, or figured it out myself during the building process.</p>
<p class="wide">To begin with the construction, one has to determine which kind of wood would be readily available and at the same time satisfy the purpose of a pottery wheel. From the one end, the wood is going to be in constant contact with water, from the other end it will provide the momentum upon which the clay will get its shape after being pressed against. Thus, it has to be a wood that responds well to water and which is very dense (heavy) as to maintain a strong angular momentum. Unfortunately, to find such characteristics in a wood is not that easy, unless you have a wood handler specialized in hardwoods. In the sawmill near my hometown neighborhood I was lucky I could find <em>encino</em>, a local type of oak of the <em>Quercus</em> genus with a reddish coloration. Encino wood is very heavy and it also behaves well in contact with water.</p>

<p class="mono dim wide" style="line-height:1em;">First steps into the construction: assembly of thick wood plates from encino beams</p>

<p>In the sawmill I was lucky I could gather some encino beams of 6x12cm, some beams of 6x6cm and some smaller rods which would serve as the posts (~5x5cm). What I did afterwards was to cut the beams in various pieces of 39cm in length, then, by combining these resulting beam segments (6x12x39cm and 6x6x39cm) together, I planed them flat and glue them together into four cuboids of around 6x39x39cm. Afterwards, I sanded them and again I glued two of the cuboids together for the top turntable and the other two for the bottom kickwheel. Before being glued, tablehe two cuboids for the bottom wheel also required having a ~5cm hole drilled in them as to allow the shaft to pass through.</p>

<p class="mono dim wide" style="line-height:1em;">Top: Cutting the cuboids into wheels. Bottom: Design of the base and the base</p>

<p class="wide">The next steps involved the cutting of the two glued blocks into the wheels. For this I required some extra help. I am lucky to be cousin with Hernán, a very talented carpenter. From him I could get the proper tools and learn form his expertise during the building process. He also helped me throughout the assembly. We cut the two blocks with a band saw and drilled 1 inch holes to fit each of the four posts. Additionally, we drilled an extra 1 inch hole at the bottom center of the top turntable. This allowed to fit the pin.</p>
<p class="wide">Once all pieces were assembled, and before I could throw my first pieces in it, I gave the kerokuro a finish with Danish oil.</p>
